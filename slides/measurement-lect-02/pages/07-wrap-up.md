# PCA vs. Factor Analysis

- Variables
  - PCA is a model of observed variables
  - Factor analysis is a model of latent variables
- Data
  - PCA focuses on reconstructing the diagonals of the covariance matrix (individual variances)
  - Factor analysis focuses on reconstructing the off-diagonals of the covariance matrix (between-item covariances)
  - PCA produces orthogonal dimensions
  - Factor analysis can produce correlated factors
- Important to note that PCA and factor analysis usually (but not always) produce different results
- Often factor analysis produces more interpretable factors with an oblique rotation that allows for correlated factors

# Problem Set 1

- Posted!
- Two weeks to complete
- You won't be able to finish all of it until after next week's lecture!
- Topics covered:
  - Comparing and contrasting PCA and Factor Analysis (with real data)
  - Comparing and contrasting CTT and Item Response Theory (with real data)
- Data will come from the Item Response Warehouse (IRW)
  - Website: [https://itemresponsewarehouse.org/](https://itemresponsewarehouse.org/)
  - Paper: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-025-02796-y](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-025-02796-y)
- Last year, students said this assignment took a long time. I didn't make it shorter, so start soon!
