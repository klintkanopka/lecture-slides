# Recap

- Markov Chain Monte Carlo is an exceptionally powerful algorithm!
- It has way more applications than we talked about today
- Take a course in Bayesian inference if you want to do more MCMC
- There are also tons of great extensions to MCMC
    - Simulated annealing
    - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
    - Gibbs Sampling
- This stuff is challenging, but you'll practice and implement it in your homework. Please ask questions!
