# A Note on Searching

- Everything we really do is a search problem
- The challenge is that the search spaces are often infinite
- All of the models we pick and assumptions we make limit the size of the search space
- The algorithms we use define how we carry out the search
- Good choice of models/assumptions/algorithms allow us to take intractable problems and solve them relatively quickly and easily!

# Buffon's Needle
  
  Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each with the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?

<div v-click>

## More Specifically:
  Given a needle of length $l$ dropped on a floor with parallel lines distance $t$ apart, what is the probability that the needle will lie across a line when landing?
