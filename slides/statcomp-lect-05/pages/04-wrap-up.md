# Recap: Monte Carlo Simulations

- Often a much faster way to solve problems than doing it analytically
- The general setup:
  - Write a function to do it once
  - Run the function a lot of times
  - Look at the distribution of the results
- PS3 is just six questions where you do this over and over in different ways
- I think it's very fun, but maybe I'm a sociopath?
