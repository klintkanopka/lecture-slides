# Supreme Court voting records

- We don't typically think about voting records as item response data, but it is!
  - Individuals (Justices, $i$) 
  - respond to items (cases, $j$) 
  - by endorsing the majority opinion ($X_{ij}=1$) 
  - or dissenting ($X_{ij}=0$)
- There are some key assumptions we make here---what are they?
