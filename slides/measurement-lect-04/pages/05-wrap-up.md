# Recap

- IRT is more flexible than it seems on face
  - We can use it with data that isn't from tests and surveys
  - We can model multiple latent traits simultaneously
  - We can include covariates that we believe are related to the response process
- Assignment reminders:
  - PS1 due tonight
  - PS2 posted! It contains multidimensional IRT and explanatory modeling
