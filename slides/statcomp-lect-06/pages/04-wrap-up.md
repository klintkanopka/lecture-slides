# Recap

- As it turns out, the structure of matrix math can make a lot of potentially complex calculations much simpler
- Power iteration is an algorithm we'll return to; if you can reframe problems in terms of repeated matrix multiplication, it's a very easy way to solve them!
- PCA is a really strong visualization tool and good way to summarize your data. You'll implement and interpret it in lab and PS4!
