# Recap

- Sorting presents a common problem in computer science
    - There are efficient ways to sort and there are horrible ways to sort
    - `bogosort` is an algorithm that generates random permuations of its input and then checks if it is sorted. This works, but is horrible!
    - You'll implement another sorting algorithm in PS2
- We now have the tools to do most programming tasks
    - Maybe not in an optimally efficient way, however!
    - Indexing lets us reach into objects and access the individual components in a consistent way
    - Conditionals allow us to use logical statements to make consistent decisions in code that we don't have to directly supervise
    - `for` loops allow us to repeat steps in a consistent way and do things slightly differently in each iteration
- Combining these tools allows you to build complex programs that can carry out complex tasks!
- Most of this course is built around expanding our toolkit to solve statistical problems
- You should start PS2 now. The last question, especially, is quite time consuming!
