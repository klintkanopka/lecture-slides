## Sorting

- Given a collection of objects and some way to compare them, how do you rearrange the objects in ascending order?
- Examples of things that may need sorting:
  - Lists of numbers
  - Rows in a dataframe
  - Words
- A key note is that we didn't specify _how_ these things are getting compared, just getting compared in some way! Different objects may require different types of comparisons
- We need a few more tools to do sorting from scratch, however!
