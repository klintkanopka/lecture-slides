# Our First Sorting Algorithm

- First, what even is an _algorithm?_
  - For us: _a precise set of steps to solve some problem_
- So, okay, let's come up with a sorting algorithm!
  - In a group of $3 \pm 1$, describe (in words) an algorithm that takes, as input, some vector of numbers `A` and then returns a new vector with the elements of `A` sorted in ascending order
  - Ascending is smallest to largest
  - Do this now

# Selection Sort

- This is kind of the most obvious to implement (to me, at least)
- Here's the plan:
  1. Find the smallest element in the vector
  2. Move to to the front
  3. Repeat 1-2 among the elements that are left until you're done
- Where do we need the tools we've developed so far in this class?
  - Last week: Logical statements, functions, and unit testing
  - This week: Indexing, conditionals, loops

# Selection Sort

- We care about two things with any algorithm:
  1. Is it correct?
  2. Is it efficient?
- Correctness is usually validated through proofs
- Efficiency is validated through runtime analysis
- Is `SelectionSort()` correct?
  - Does it always return a sorted version of the input?
  - Yes, but we won't prove it in this course
  - Instead, test your function until you're convinced it works

# Selection Sort

- If `A` contains $n$ elements, how many instructions (in terms of $n$) are run when you execute `SelectionSort(A)`?
  - The code in the outer loop executes $n$ times
  - The code in the inner loop runs $n$, then $n-1$, then $n-2$, ..., 1 times
  - We then say that this runs _on the order of_ $n^2$ instructions
  - Often this is written in "big-$O$ notation" as $O(n^2)$
  - There's some technical stuff here that we'll get to later
- Each line of code takes time to run, and as we use larger datasets, efficiency starts to matter a lot!
