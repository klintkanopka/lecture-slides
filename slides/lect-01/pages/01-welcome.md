# More About Your Instructor
Less important, but possibly more useful

- I have a lot of idiosyncratic coding preferences and habits
- I’m a dedicated `ggplot()` user
- I _love_ the `tidyverse` for cleaning data
- I _hate_ the `tidyverse` for absolutely everything else
- My problem sets have a pretty clear "style"
- I am going to be really picky about some things and then not picky at all about basically everything else (I’ll try my best to warn you)
- Questions?
