# Recap

- IRTrees are _incredibly_ flexible and useful for way more than you'd expect
- Unfolding models can be useful for expressing preferences with the Goldilocks property
- Elo-like systems can be useful for head-to-head competition
- This was our last lecture on vanilla-ish IRT!
- Next week we'll take a detour into topic models
  - Or, as we civilized folk say, "factor analysis for words"
- After next week, we'll bust into _categorical_ latent variables
  - We'll start with clustering, then get kinda weird
- PS3 is out! 
  - Polytomous IRT, IRTrees, and a fun surprise!
