# A Problem (and a Break)

- Download the `squash-matches.rds` data [here](https://github.com/klintkanopka/lecture-slides/blob/main/slides/Courses/measurement/measurement-lect-06/public/squash_matches.rds)
- The `player_1` and `player_2` columns have an integer that indicates which player is in the match
- The `result` column tells you if `player_1` won the match
- Using this data, rank the players from strongest to weakest
