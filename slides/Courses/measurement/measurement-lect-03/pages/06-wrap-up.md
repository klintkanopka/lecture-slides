# Recap

- Hopefully PCA and factor analysis are a little more clear
  - Readings are helpful here if you need more technical detail!
- Latent variable models pose a really wild estimation challenge!
  - The Expectation Maximization Algorithm can solve it in many cases
- Item Response Theory (IRT) puts people and items onto a common scale
  - It can even produce interval scales!

# Loose ends and looking forward

- There is a _ton_ of measurement theory that we just handwaved past
- There is also a _ton_ of IRT stuff that we also just handwaved past
- The next three weeks are all IRT, and some of the second half of the class is also IRT
  - We'll get the other IRT stuff gradually instead of just dumping a pile of crap into our brains today
  - Measurement theory stuff will come gradually as well
- Next week: more IRT, multidimensional IRT, and shoving non-item response data into IRT models
- The week after: polytomous IRT (multiple response categories, great for you survey weirdos)
- The week after that: weird IRT models (Elo scores, ideal point models) and data that you might not think of as item responses
