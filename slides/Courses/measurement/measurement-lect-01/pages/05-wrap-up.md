# Recap

- This course is concerned with the measurement of individual-level latent variables
- Scoring is the fundamental process of measurement
- Validity is the idea that we're actually measuring something that makes sense
  - We'll discuss this more next week
- Reliability is a necessary (but insufficient) condition for validity
- Classical Test Theory is mostly concerned with sources of measurement error and provides some intuitive tools for understanding both respondents and items

# Problem Set 0

- Currently released, must be submitted on Gradescope
    - Due Friday, January 30th at 11.59p
    - Give yourself some time for the actual submission process if you've never used Gradescope before!
- Pretty typical of what you can expect from my assignments, just shorter
- First question gives you an item response data set, and you will:
  - Recode it, rename variables, and make a table
  - Answer a few questions with some plots
  - Fit a regression and interpret the coefficients
- Second question walks you through a Monte Carlo simulation to explore the "Birthday Problem"
  - Write two functions to carry out the simulation
  - Put them together to do one iteration of the simulation
  - Loop over a bunch of conditions and make a plot
