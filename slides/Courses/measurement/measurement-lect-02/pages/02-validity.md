# Validity

- On the most basic level, the idea that we have confidence we are measuring the thing we think we are measuring
- Starts with the definition of a _construct_, or the unobservable thing we care about measuring
- Requires some combination of theory and some amount of empirical study to get at

# Validity

1. Take 5-10 minutes and in groups of $3 \pm 1$, discuss the differences between Cronbach and Meehl's conception of "construct validity," Kane's idea of validity, and Boorsboom's idea of validity
2. What are the pros/cons of each approach? 
3. Where might each approach succeed or fail?
4. What approach do you agree with most?

# Cronbach and Meehl

- Construct validity is derived from the nomological network
- Core idea: Since we cannot directly observe the latent construct of interest, we have to collect a dense network of evidence through theoretical arguments and correlations to support our ideas of validity
- The idea of "construct validity" and other "types" of validity is extremely antiquated

# Kane
 
- Validity is associated with the interpretation assigned to test scores rather than with the test scores or the test 
- Interpretive arguments lay out how a test score will be interpreted and what evidence needs to be brought to bear to evaluate the argument
- Core idea: Validity is highly contextual and changes to instruments or populations can result in changes to the construct being measured

# Boorsboom

- A test is valid for measuring an attribute if (a) the attribute exists and (b) variations in the attribute causally produce variation in the measurement outcomes
- Focuses on causal reasoning
- Core idea: Validity should be a function of an instrument, not a score interpretation
