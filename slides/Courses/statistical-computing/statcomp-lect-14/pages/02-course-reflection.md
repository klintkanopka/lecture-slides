# Revisiting Formal Course Goals

1. Students will implement literate programming to produce coherent and reproducible code.
2. Students will verify code function through the implementation of unit tests.
3. Students will write more efficient code by applying optimization techniques (e.g., vectorization, parallelization).
4. Students will solve problems by implementing and modifying algorithms.
5. Students will answer statistical questions by implementing Monte Carlo simulations.

# The _Real_ Course Goals

1. Be more comfortable with using `R` like a programming language
  - Loops and control flow (`if`, `else`, `while`, `for`)
  - Boolean logic, `TRUE` and `FALSE` tricks
  - Going from a code sketch in words to functional code
  - Fixing and diagnosing your errors
2. Start seeing the world as full of computable problems
  - If you're clever about framing, everything is a search or optimization problem
  - Most things can be solved with `optim()` or MCMC

# The _Real_ Course Goals (continued)  
  
3. Discuss some things you don't necessarily learn elsewhere in the program
  - Some of the nuts and bolts of numerical optimization
  - Regularization, cross-validation
  - Clustering and PCA
4. Help you understand that you don't have to be fully reliant on the software that's already been written!
  - You can implement algorithms in `R`!

# What could have gone better?

- I don't feel great about the PCA and SVD lectures
  - Either requires more scaffolding or a total revamp/replacement
- Assignment length could be more consistent
- Lab attendance was poor
- Office hours weren't efficiently utilized

# What went well?

- You are all **much** stronger programmers than you were in September!
- Everyone did really well on assignments
- Lab quality improved over the course of the semester
  - Still room for improvement here! If you want to teach lab and help me improve this next year, let me know!
- Some activities, assignments, and lectures feel really good
- Slack continues to seem really helpful for course-related communication and community building
