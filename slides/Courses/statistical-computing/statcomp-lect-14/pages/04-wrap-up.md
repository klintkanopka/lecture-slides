# Recap

- Final exam
    - You can bring one $8.5 \times 11$ sheet of notes
    - The focus is less on memorizing specific algorithms and more on writing and understanding efficient and effective `R` code
    - Think about stuff we've hammered all semester: `if`, `else`, `while`, `for` are most of it
