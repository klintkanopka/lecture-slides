# Wrapping up

- We covered a lot of kinda bland introductory material, with not a lot of context!
- Your lab on Wednesday is devoted to practicing `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` 
- Lab is also a place where you'll go over homework-related problems and can ask questions. Use Ruiting as a resource!
- Ask questions on Slack!
- PS0 is posted and due before class next week
- PS1 will post tonight or tomorrow and be due in two weeks
