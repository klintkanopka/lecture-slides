# Your Instructor

- Klint Kanopka 
- Third year assistant professor of applied statistics
- I'm _mostly_ a psychometrician, but I have a background in computational physics and machine learning
- Please call me Klint if you feel comfortable doing so
- This is the third time this course has ever existed, so I'm _very_ interested in feedback
- Email me: [klint.kanopka@nyu.edu](klint.kanopka@nyu.edu)
- Office Hours: W 2p-3p @ Kimball, Rm 205W

# Fun Facts

- I have a lot of idiosyncratic coding preferences and habits
- I'm a dedicated `ggplot()` user
- I love the `tidyverse` for cleaning data
- I hate the `tidyverse` for absolutely everything else
- I think everything we do should be presented four ways:
  1. Intuitively
  2. Mathematically
  3. Computationally
  4. Applied
- My problem sets have a pretty clear "style"
- I am going to be really picky about some things and then not picky at all about basically everything else (I'll try my best to warn you)
- Questions?

# Prerequisites

- You should know right now:
  - `R`, the programming language
  - Data Visualization
  - Regression
  - Probability
- One (or both) of these are helpful, but definitely not required:
  - Survey methods
  - Unsupervised machine learning

# Course Grades

- Three-credit course
- Eight equally-weighted problem sets (PS0-PS7)
- Participation is basically a subjective assessment of "are you doing class"
- Extra credit points are added directly to the total for problem sets
- I probably set up the Brightspace gradebook wrong
- Category weights: 

| Category      | $p$   |
|---------------|-------|
| Problem Sets  | $0.9$ |
| Participation | $0.1$ |

# Problem Sets

- Released on (or before) class on Thursdays
- Due on Fridays @ 11.59p
- PS0 is a one week assignment
- PS1-PS6 are two week assignments
- PS7 is longer, due during finals week, and more like a "project"
- Use my `.qmd` template and submit the compiled `.pdf` file on Gradescope
  - You should be prepared to submit the `.qmd` upon request
- Do not call `install.packages()`
- For more specifics, see syllabus

# Participation

- If I remember who you are, see you in class, and you're reasonably engaged in the stuff we do, you'll get full credit
- Understand that this is partially subjective
- Attendance will be taken in class using PollEverywhere and you must enable your device's location settings to receive credit for attending

# Extra Credit

- One point to the first person to identify a typo or mistake in **any** of the course materials I write
  - Problem sets
  - Book
  - Slides
- If there are code mistakes or more serious issues and you provide fixes, you'll get more than one point, consistent with effort required
- "Valuable suggestions" include proposed examples, datasets, ways to increase clarity, new topics, and applications
  - If I _plan_ to adopt a suggestion, you'll get extra credit
  - If I _actually_ adopt a suggestion, you'll get acknowledgement in course materials

# Collaboration Policy

- You should form study groups and work together on problem sets!
- You must:
  - Report at the top of your assignment who you consulted with
  - Write your code, answers, and solutions independently
  - Understand your work well enough to reconstruct it entirely on your own
- What if you don't have friends in the class?
  - PRIISM has a great lounge, and it's a great place to co-work!
  - It's the area right outside my office, so maybe hang out during office hours?
  - Working with others is mutually beneficial

# AI Tool Policy

- See the syllabus for the full policy
- Don't use generative AI to automatically write your code, analyze your data, or write text for you
- What do you do if you're stuck?
  - Stack Overflow
  - Stack Exchange
  - Ask your classmates!
  - Come to office hours!

- If not ask me questions! 
- I am super excited for this class
  - I hope you are too!
  - I will make mistakes
  - Tell me if you need things
