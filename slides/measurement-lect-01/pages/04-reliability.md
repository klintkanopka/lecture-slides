# Reliability

- In groups of $3 \pm 1$, discuss the following questions:
  - What does it mean for something to be reliable? 
  - In what contexts do you think about or hear the term "reliability?"
  - What could it mean for a test to be reliable?
  - What strategies could you use to _quantify_ the degree to which a test is reliable?

# Reliability

- Reliability is the overall consistency of scores on a test
  - "Scores that are highly reliable are precise, reproducible, and consistent from one testing occasion to another. That is, if the testing process were repeated with a group of test takers, essentially the same results would be obtained."[^1]
- Estimated a few different ways:
  - **Test-retest reliability** - If you give the test repeatedly, does it produce the same scores?
  - **Parallel-forms reliability** - If you make two versions of the same test, are the scores across forms correlated?
  - **Split-half reliability** - If you give the test once, are scores on half the items correlated with scores on the other half? (Often we correlate odd and even items)
  - **Internal consistency** - Are responses to each item correlated with responses to each other item? (This is Cronbach's Alpha - it's the mean split-half reliability across all possible splits of a test)

# Validity

- On the most basic level, the idea that we have confidence we are measuring the thing we think we are measuring
- Starts with the definition of a _construct_, or the unobservable thing we care about measuring
- Requires some amount of theory and some amount of empirical study to get at
    - The three papers we'll discuss next week are all about this specifically
- Reliability is a necessary _but insufficient_ condition for validity!
- We'll discuss this more next week after you read the Cronbach & Meehl, Kane, and Boorsboom, Mellenbergh, & van Heerden papers!
