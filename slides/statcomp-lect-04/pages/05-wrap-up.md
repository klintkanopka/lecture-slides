# Recap

- Clustering has tons of applications in social science!
    - Putting things into groups is helpful, but sometimes we really don't know what the groups should be
    - If you want to learn more about clustering and similar unsupervised learning paradigms, take a look at my course "Modern Approaches in Measurement" happening in Spring Semester!
- Distance metrics give us a way to quantify how similar (or different) two observations are
    - The distance measure you choose dictates what features of the data are prioritized during this comparison
- `while` loops are our last major tool for control flow
    - Great for checking convergence conditions
    - If you can do a job with a `for` loop, however, prioritize using that
