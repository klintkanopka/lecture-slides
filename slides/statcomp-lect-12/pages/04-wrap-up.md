# Recap

- Debugging is challenging, but we have four (five?) main tools:
  - Googling error messages
  - `print()` statements
  - `traceback()`
  - `browser()`
  - Maybe ChatGPT if you like it?
- The `apply()` family of functions allows you to hide loops
  - Not more efficient, but _safer_ than loops
  - Encourages functionalization of code
  - Makes code easier to read
