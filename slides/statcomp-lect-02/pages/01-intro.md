# Announcements

- Office hours update
  - Tons of people came, felt very productive
  - Some people just used that as time to work on their problem sets without specific questions, which is a good idea!
- PS0 is due 9/12 @ 11.59p
  - I'm generally pleased with the questions that I received and the work I saw people do!
  - This is mostly what my assignments look like
    1. Do some stuff
    2. Plot the stuff
    3. Tell me what you think about the stuff
- PS1 is out!
  - It is still due on 9/18 before class
  - I think it's more straightforward than PS0
  - It's all about writing functions to do things
